# TheatreVertigo

**Introduction**
----------------

>For this project I was tasked with constructing the Cast Member pages for Theatre Vertigo's website. We used ASP.NET Framework with a MVC structure.  
I used Razor with C#, HTML, and minimal JS on the Views. The Controllers were written in C# and so were the Models.  
Below I will share some specific details with you.

**Restricted Pages**
--------------------
>Some pages are restricted to the Cast Director role using Identity.
